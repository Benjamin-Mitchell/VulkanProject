I'll be uploading it publicly as i progress, so feel free to have a look at what I'm currently working on. 

If you would like to contribute and discuss what is best for performance/visual reasons etc. please feel free to.

If learning is your goal, you're more than welcome to read throuh the code, or feel free to send me questions.

The basis of this Vulkan project, as well as my favourite source of Vulkan wisdom can be found [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) (Thank you Overv!!). 

You can also find Overv's code for the tutorials [here](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial).
