I'll be uploading it publicly as i progress, so feel free to have a look at what I'm currently working on. 

If you would like to contribute and discuss what is best for performance/visual quality etc. please feel free to.

If learning is your goal, you're more than welcome to read throuh the code, or feel free to send me questions.

You can also find Overv's code for the tutorials [here](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial).
